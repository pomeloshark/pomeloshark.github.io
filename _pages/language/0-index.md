## notes on usage

Introductory linguistics textbooks, and indeed degree programs, typically follow a trajectory of *phonology* ---> *morphology* ---> *syntax*. This is a very idealized way of doing things -- all three subjects interrelate and overlap significantly. Additionally, it isn't always the most useful order if you're building a language from scratch, since most textbooks are designed to introduce you to linguistic *analysis*: determining what features a language displays based on the linguistic data that's been gathered. But conlangers are not starting out with a data set to interpret -- we're choosing our language's traits and then building the data from there. It may be more useful, then, to introduce concepts in reverse order. I'm choosing here to introduce some syntactic features before morphological ones, because in the case of many natural languages, these syntactic features determine which morphological ones appear.
