As far as I'm aware all major system fonts have IPA support; if you're using another font that doesn't, it'll use your system font as a fallback. This is readable but usually doesn't look too great; for producing documents you'll want to use a font with full IPA support.

Note: some fonts have not yet been updated to include a couple of recent additions to the IPA, the labiodental flap ⱱ and the linguolabial diacritic e̼. Some are missing the Chao tone letters, or more rarely, click symbols. This typically isn't a dealbreaker but I've noted where symbols are missing.

## Default & system fonts

Your computer's system font should be able to display most, if not all, IPA characters.

If you're on a Mac: Arial, Baskerville (although it's missing quite a few diacritics), Charter, Courier and Courier New, Geneva, Helvetica and Helvetica Neue, Hiragino Maru Gothic and Hiragino Mincho, Lucida Grande, Menlo, Microsoft Sans Serif, Monaco, STIX, Tahoma, Times New Roman, Toppan Bunkyu Gothic and Toppan Bunkyu Mincho, and YuGothic and YuMincho.

If you're on Windows: Arial, Cambria, Calibri, Consolas, Courier New, Lucida Sans Unicode, Microsoft Sans Serif, Segoe UI, Tahoma, Times New Roman, and YuGothic and YuMincho.

If you're on Linux: fonts vary by distro, but some common families to look out for are Charter, DejaVu, GNU Free Fonts, Liberation, Libertine & Libertinus, and Nimbus.
