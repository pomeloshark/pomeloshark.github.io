## Our only case study

how things (probably) went on earth
- period of chaos in emerging solar system
  - the moon
- cooled earth and basalt
- oceans
- continents and beginnings of tectonic activity
- glaciation

---

## Geosphere

- surface formation
- internal structure and processes
- plate tectonics
- geologic provinces, mineral deposits & soils


### Implementing

implementing plate tectonics - some cheats for reverse engineering

The most realistic way to do this would be to start with some primordial cratons and build from there; [here](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2020/01/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-va.html) is a tutorial on how to do this using GPlates. However, I realize most of us (myself definitely included) have at least a vague notion of the map we want to work with, and so end up kind of working backwards and forwards simultaneously. It's not impossible, but it will keep you on your toes for a while.

Some points to keep in mind:
- Remember that the continents are not floating on top of the oceans: you need to account for the entire surface, not just the stuff that's above the water. It may be helpful to picture the ocean floor as the part that's moving, and any collisions of continents as by-products of that.
- Remember that you're working on the surface of a sphere. The movement of your continents is not constricted in any way by the edges of your map! Make heavy use of a tool like MapToGlobe so that you can better visualize this at all times.
- Don't panic if your existing landmasses don't line up well -- it's the edges of the continental shelves that need to line up, and sea levels are always changing.
