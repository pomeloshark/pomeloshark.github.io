## On habitability

- what makes a planet habitable or, which earth traits should we steal
  - star traits
  - planet traits
    - lotta water
    - plate tectonics and supercontinent cycle
    - axial tilt and seasonal variation
  - moons?

## The universe

- where did stuff come from?
  - big bang, primordial nucleosynthesis and recombination
- what existed in the early universe?
- processes of collapse and accretion
  - formation of the first stars
  - population and other forms of nucleosynthesis
- the large scale structure of the universe
- what is present in the universe today?
   - stars > stellar clusters > galaxy > clusters > superclusters > filaments > voids
   - stars < planets and other simple bodies
   - intergalactic/interstellar/interplanetary medium, cosmic dust, nebulae

### Where do we get the elements?

- nucleosynthesis
  - supernova
  - neutron star
  - black hole
  - cosmic ray spallation

## Stars

formation, evolution, life cycle

## Planetary systems

what kind of stars support planets

planetary disks

how it probably went on earth

what kinds of bodies exist in a system
- definition of a planet
- types of planets
- satellites
- asteroids
- comets
- belts, clouds
- moons

### Orbital mechanics

## Building

### Star

+ stellar class -> mass, radius, luminosity, effective temperature
+ main sequence lifetime
+ surface flux, radiant flux at 10 parsecs
+ bolometric magnitude, absolute & apparent + bolometric correction; angular diameter

### System parameters

+ the ice/snow/frost line
+ equivalent earth irradiance
+ Kopparapu et al studies on greenhouse limits

### Planet

mass caps
- 2.0 ± 0.7 (chen & kipping 2016)
- 2.0 (zeng et al 2016)

radius caps
- 1.48 +0.08 -0.04 (rogers 2015)
- 1.23 +0.44 -0.22 (chen & kipping 2016)
- 1.5 (lopez & fortney 2014)
- 1.2 (simpson 2016)

+ gravity, density
+ escape velocity

+ orbital radius, eccentricity, apses, etc
+ orbital period, tropical year
+ sidereal day, solar/synodic day

+ other orbital characteristics

+ axial tilt/obliquity; variation, precession
+ radiant flux or solar irradiance, equilibrium temperature, mean global surface temperature
+ albedo
+ distance to horizon

### Moons

+ how massive should your moon system be
+ radius, composition, mass, gravity, density
+ roche limit, hill sphere
+ orbital radius & period; synodic period
+ angular diameter, apparent magnitudes
+ tidal forces

### The rest of the system

+ etc
+ resonances & titius-bode law
+ colouration
