## notes on usage

The information here is mainly relevant to my own worldbuilding process and projects, which hinge on having an Earth-like planet with Earth-like climates, seasonal variations, et cetera. I'm not so much interested in science fiction as I am in building plain old human cultures, just in a setting that has nothing to do with our own. If your plans involve something similar, this is for you! If you're interested in pushing a planet to the limits of habitability, there'll be something here for you, albeit less with each successive section. If you're looking to alter the laws of physics or explore alien biochemistries then you're almost certainly more knowledgeable than me already. A couple good resources for more speculative and hard science fiction are [Atomic Rockets](http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/index.php), Xenology, and [Artifexian]()'s YouTube channel.

Disclaimer: I'm just a person with an internet connection. I enjoy doing research; I'm not an expert in any field. If you see a mistake or think something isn't expressed clearly enough, let me know! Additionally, if you have any questions that aren't answered here, I would be happy to try and answer them; you can find me on reddit @[pomeloshark]().
